Fork this project with the original description and write your own code.

Commit the important milestones and not just the final result!


Exercise description
--------------------

Create a Rails project, with a simple controller logic.

We need a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of the number.

For example:
<pre>
7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
</pre>

That's all.

Extra points: write your code in TDD / BDD, use cucumber, rspec, or other test frameworks
