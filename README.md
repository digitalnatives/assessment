# Arabic number conversion tool

Create a web-based solution that converts numeric input into the English phrase of that number.

For example:
<pre>
7       === seven
42      === forty-two
1999    === one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
2001    === two thousand and one
17999   === seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
342251  === three hundred and forty-two thousand two hundred and fifty-one
1300420 === one million three hundred thousand four hundred and twenty
</pre>

Note: Numbers greater than 100 and less than 1000 always include the word "and" between the hundreds figure and the other part, numbers greater than 1000 include "and" between any hundreds figure and the figure less than 100.

Treat this task like a project to create a real-life application, focus on other aspects too, not just the code:
- Fork this project.
- Use the best stack matching the simplicity of the task.
- Don't use external libraries for the conversion.
- Make the solution pleasant to look at and user friendly in as many aspects as you can.
- Commit the important milestones and not just the final result.
- Don't forget to write tests. We expect the tests to check also the examples above.
- Try to support numbers as high as you can.
- (Optional) Try to support British English counting where numbers between 1000 and 2000 are said out using "hundreds". E.g. 1999 === nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
