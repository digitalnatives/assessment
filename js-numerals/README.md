Exercise description
--------------------

Create a frontend application.

We need a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of the number.

For example:
<pre>
7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
</pre>

That's all.

Extra points:

* write your code in TDD / BDD, use any test frameworks

For test:
<pre>
    npm install
</pre>
<pre>
    karma start
</pre>

For run the website:
<pre>
    npm start
</pre>
