Create an application that contains a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When the user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of that number.

For example:

7    == seven
42   == forty-two
2001 == two thousand and one
1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine
17999 == seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
